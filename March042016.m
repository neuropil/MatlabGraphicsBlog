% Recently I heard from a MATLAB user who was trying to draw tubes along a
% curve using
% <http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2014/12/16/down-the-tubes/ this blog
% post> I wrote a while back. Unfortunately her curve was a bit more
% complex than the ones I used in that post. That approach of sweeping a 2D
% shape along a curve has a number of interesting edge cases that you'll
% encounter when your curves are complex.
%
% In particular, her curve actually had a "fork" in it. This is a
% particularly tough case for the sweep approach. You basically need to
% sweep each of the two halves of the fork, and then slice off the parts of
% one sweep that are inside the other one. The math for this gets rather
% tricky.
%
% Luckily there's another approach to this problem. This one is fairly
% compute intensive, but it's quite a bit simpler to implement. It's called
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function signed distance fields>. Let's take a look at how you would solve this
% problem using an SDF.
%
% First we'll need some sample data. Here's one I made. I have 4 vertices.
%
verts = [-1    0 0; ...
        1/2    0 0; ...
          2  3/4 0; ...
          2 -3/4 0];
radius = .5;

%%
% And I have 3 line segments which connect the four vertices.
%
segments = [1 2; 2 3; 2 4];

%%
% Let's draw the segments.
%
for i=1:size(segments,1)
    line(verts(segments(i,:),1),verts(segments(i,:),2),verts(segments(i,:),3))
end
box on
daspect([1 1 1])
view(3)

%%
% So we want a tube-like surface which follows those line segments, and
% smoothly blends between two which fork off to the right.
%
% The first thing we'll do is build a 3D grid over the space we're interested 
% in. The bigger you make the grid, the better your surface will be, but 
% the amount of memory youâ€™re using will climb quickly.
%
[y,x,z] = ndgrid(linspace(-1.25,1.25,90),linspace(-1,2.25,90),linspace(-0.75,0.75,45));

%%
% And now we'll create a 4th array to hold our signed distance field.
%
d = zeros(size(z));

%%
% Now we loop over all of the grid points. At each point in the grid, we'll
% loop over all of the line segments and calculate the distance from the
% grid point to the closest point on the line segment. We'll keep the
% smallest distance and save it in d.
%
for i=1:numel(z)
    p = [x(i),y(i),z(i)];
    
    % Intialize our distance to inf.
    closest = inf;
    
    % Loop over all of the line segments.
    for j=1:size(segments,1)
        q1 = verts(segments(j,1),:);
        q2 = verts(segments(j,2),:);
        
        % For line segment q1 + t*(q2-q1), compute the value of t where
        % distance to p is minimized. Clamp to [0 1] so we don't go off
        % the end of the line segment.
        invlen2 = 1/dot(q2-q1,q2-q1);
        t = max(0,min(1,-dot(q1-p,q2-q1)*invlen2));
        v = q1 + t*(q2-q1);
        
        % Is that  the smallest we've seen for this grid element?
        closest = min(closest, norm(v-p)-radius);
    end
    
    % Insert the distance into the array.
    d(i) = closest;
end

%%
% Notice that the value I saved into the array d was the distance from that
% grid point to a line segment, minus the radius of the surface at that
% point on the line segment. That means that anywhere in our grid that d is
% less than 0 is inside the tube, and anywhere that d is greater than 0 is
% outside the tube. As we saw in
% <http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2015/03/03/implicit-curves/ this
% post> about implicit surfaces, this is a job for the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isosurface.html isosurface
% function>.
%
isosurface(x,y,z,d,0)
camlight

%%
% And we can see that this surface lines up nicely with our original model,
% and does a nice job of blending that fork.
%
% Let's delete the lines and change the view so we can see inside the fork.
% See how tidy that intersection is? That would be hard to do with the other
% approach.
%
% Also notice how it rounds off the ends. We can see inside because I made
% the grid pretty tight. If my grid had been a bit larger, then each of the
% three ends would be capped by a hemisphere. This is characteristic of
% the signed distance fields approach.
%
delete(findobj(gca,'Type','line'))
view([41 18])

%%
% But what if we had a different radius at each vertex, and wanted the tube
% to interpolate between the radii at the end of each segment?
%
% Let's say that we wanted the following radii at each vertex.
%
radii = [.5 .45 .125 .25];

cla
for i=1:size(segments,1)
    line(verts(segments(i,:),1),verts(segments(i,:),2),verts(segments(i,:),3))
end
[xs,ys,zs] = sphere;
for i=1:size(verts,1)
    surface(verts(i,1)+radii(i)*xs, ...

% This is a little trickier, but it's basically just a matter of changing
% our distance function. We can no longer use the simple formula for the
% distance between a point and the centerline. 
%
% I found a distance function that will do the job in 
% <http://liris.cnrs.fr/Documents/Liris-1297.pdf this paper>:
%

% <table border=0>
% <tr><td>Fast distance computation between a point and cylinders, cones,
%   line swept spheres and cone-spheres</td></tr>

% <tr><td>LIRIS - CNRS</td></tr>
% <tr><td>Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1</td></tr>
% <tr><td>69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France</td></tr>
% </table>

%
% The authors call this primitive with a centerline and a radius at each end the 
% "cone-sphere" primitive. 
%
% This distance equation is more complex, so I'll precompute some terms to 
% help with performance.
%
nsegments = size(segments,1);
invlen2 = zeros(1,nsegments);
trange = zeros(nsegments,2);
adj_radii = zeros(nsegments,2);
for i=1:nsegments
    q1 = verts(segments(i,1),:);
    q2 = verts(segments(i,2),:);
    len2 = dot(q2-q1,q2-q1);
    invlen2(i) = 1/len2;

    r1 = radii(segments(i,1));
    r2 = radii(segments(i,2));
    delta = r1-r2;
    s = sqrt(len2 - delta^2);
    
    dl = delta * invlen2(i);
    sl = s * sqrt(invlen2(i));
    
    trange(i,1) = r1 * dl;
    trange(i,2) = 1 + r2 * dl;
    adj_radii(i,1) = r1 * sl;
    adj_radii(i,2) = r2 * sl;
end

%%
% Now we can repeat our loop with this new distance formula.
%
for i=1:numel(z)
    p = [x(i),y(i),z(i)];
    
    closest = inf;
    for j=1:size(segments,1)
        q1 = verts(segments(j,1),:);
        q2 = verts(segments(j,2),:);
        r1 = radii(segments(j,1));
        r2 = radii(segments(j,2));
        
        t = -dot(q1-p,q2-q1)*invlen2(j);
        if t<trange(j,1)
            v = q1;
            r = r1;
        elseif t>trange(j,2)
            v = q2;
            r = r2;
        else
            v = q1 + t*(q2-q1);
            adj_t = (t-trange(j,1)) / (trange(j,2)-trange(j,1));
            r = adj_radii(j,1) + adj_t*(adj_radii(j,2)-adj_radii(j,1));
        end
        
        closest = min(closest, norm(v-p)-r);
    end
    
    d(i) = closest;
end

%%
% And then we can use isosurface, just like we did before.
%
isosurface(x,y,z,d,0)

%%
% See how the surface lines up with the spheres? Now we'll delete them to
% get a better look.
%
delete(findobj(gca,'Type','line'))
delete(findobj(gca,'Type','surface'))


%%
% Here's another isosurface I made from these 6 edges of a tetrahedron 
% using this technique.
%
verts = randn(4,3);
segments = nchoosek(1:4,2);
radii = 5/8 * rand(1,4);

%%

%
% That took quite a while to compute, but it would have been awful tricky
% to draw it with the sweep approach. 
%
% Whenever you want to wrap a surface around a complex shape, then signed
% distance functions are a technique that you should consider.
