% Another new feature that I really like in <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes.html#R2016a R2016a> is the upgraded fplot function and
% all of the new members of the fplot family. 
%
% The <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fplot.html fplot function> 
% has been around for a long time. The basic idea is that you pass it a
% function which takes X coordinates as inputs and returns Y coordinates as
% outputs. Then fplot will use that function to draw a curve.
%
fplot(@(x) sin(x))

%%
% This is really useful for getting a "quick feel" for the shape of a
% function, or a family of functions.
%
fplot(@(x) besselj(x,1),[0 2*pi])
hold on
fplot(@(x) besselj(x,2),[0 2*pi])
fplot(@(x) besselj(x,3),[0 2*pi])
fplot(@(x) besselj(x,4),[0 2*pi])
fplot(@(x) besselj(x,5),[0 2*pi])
hold off

%%
% In addition to functions, if you have the <http://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic/
% Symbolic Math Toolbox>, fplot can also accept symbolic variables now.
% This gives it even more power. For example, I can reproduce that plot
% with a single call to fplot by calling <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/besselj.html besselj>
% with a symbolic variable for the domain and a vector for the order.
%

fplot(besselj(x,1:5),[0,2*pi])

%%
% The new version of fplot has a lot of nice refinements, such as the nice 
% legend entries in those last two examples.
%
% When we first showed the new fplot to Cleve, he gave it one of 
% <http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2012/09/24/supremum/ his favorite functions>. 
%
% $$tan(sin(x)) + sin(tan(x))$$
%
% This is what the previous version of fplot did with that.
%
% <<http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/files/R2015b_tansin.png>>
%
% And here's the R2016a version.
%
fplot(@(x) tan(sin(x)) + sin(tan(x)))

%%
% As you can see, it does a better of resolving the details in those tricky
% bits. And it labeled the asymptotes for use, although it missed the one 
% at $-\pi/2$. The reason Cleve likes this function is that it's a bit of 
% a torture test!
%
% And we can get even more detail if we zoom in.
%
xlim(pi/2 + [-.2 .2])

%%
% Another big enhancement is that fplot can now do parametric curves as
% well as plotting Y as a function of X. To do this, we just pass it two 
% functions. The first function takes the parameter value as input and
% returns X coordinates. The second function takes the parameter value as
% input and returns Y coordinates.
%
% For example, I can use it to
% recreate the cubic BÃ©zier curve from
% <http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2014/10/13/bezier-curves/ this blog
% post>. This is a bit simpler than the way I did it in that post. Especially if you're
% not familiar with things like <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/kron.html Kronecker tensor products>.
% Note, you'll need the placelabel function I wrote in that earlier blog post.
%
clf
pt1 = [ 5;-10];
pt2 = [18; 18];
pt3 = [38; -5];
pt4 = [45; 15];

placelabel(pt2,'pt_2');
placelabel(pt3,'pt_3');
placelabel(pt4,'pt_4');

      @(t)cubic_bezier(t,pt1(2),pt2(2),pt3(2),pt4(2)), ...
      [0 1])

% But one of the coolest features of the new version of fplot is hiding at
% the bottom of <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fplot.html the
% doc page>. If you look down there, you'll see this:

% </html>
%
% That's right, there's now a whole family of fplot-like functions! 
%
% Let's take a look at some of these new ones.
%
% First there's fplot3. It's used for 3D parametric curves, like the ones I
% wrote about in these earlier posts on this blog
% (<http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2014/12/04/tie-a-ribbon-round-it-parametric-curves-part-1/
% link1>, <http://blogs.mathworks.com/graphics/2014/12/16/down-the-tubes/
% link2>). We just pass it 3 functions, like this:
%
fplot3(@(t) 3*cos(t)+cos(10*t).*cos(t), ...
       @(t) 3*sin(t)+cos(10*t).*sin(t), ...
       @(t) sin(10*t))
daspect([1 1 1])

%%
% Here's another of my favorite 3D parametric curves. It's commonly known 
% as the <http://paulbourke.net/geometry/baseball baseball curve>.
%
a = .4;
xfcn = @(t)sin(pi/2-(pi/2-a)*cos(t)).*cos(t/2+a*sin(2*t));
yfcn = @(t)sin(pi/2-(pi/2-a)*cos(t)).*sin(t/2+a*sin(2*t));
zfcn = @(t)cos(pi/2-(pi/2-a)*cos(t));

fplot3(xfcn,yfcn,zfcn,[0 4*pi])
axis equal

%%
% There's also the new <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fsurf.html fsurf function>. 
% This means that instead of calling peaks to generate arrays of data ...
%
[x,y,z] = peaks;

%%
% ... and then passing that data to surf, ...
surf(x,y,z)
xlim([-3 3])
ylim([-3 3])
title('surf(peaks)')

%%
% I can just call fsurf with a handle to the peaks function. 
%
fsurf(@(x,y) peaks(x,y),[-3 3 -3 3])
title('fsurf(@(x,y) peaks(x,y))')

%%
% This results in a very similar picture, but look what happens when we zoom in.
%
% <<fsurf_zoom_animation.gif>>
%
% It's regenerating the mesh on the fly during the zoom. With the surf
% command, we'd only get the resolution of our original call to peaks.
%
% <<surf_zoom_animation.gif>>
%
% This makes the fplot family really useful for exploring a function with
% pan and zoom.
%

%%
% All of the functions I've used so far have been simple enough to write as
% anonymous functions. But sometimes you'll want to use more complex
% functions. For example, I've turned the parametric equation for the 
% <http://www.kleinbottle.com/ Klein bottle> into the 
% following set of functions:
%
%   function x = klein_xfcn(u,v)
%     mask1 = u<pi;
%     mask2 = ~mask1;
%     r = klein_rfcn(u);
%     x = zeros(size(u));
%     x(mask1) = 6*cos(u(mask1)).*(1+sin(u(mask1))) + r(mask1).*cos(u(mask1)).*cos(v(mask1));
%     x(mask2) = 6*cos(u(mask2)).*(1+sin(u(mask2))) + r(mask2).*cos(v(mask2)+pi);
%
%   function y = klein_yfcn(u,v)
%     mask1 = u<pi;
%     mask2 = ~mask1;
%     r = klein_rfcn(u);
%     y = zeros(size(u));
%     y(mask1) = 16*sin(u(mask1)) + r(mask1).*sin(u(mask1)).*cos(v(mask1));
%     y(mask2) = 16*sin(u(mask2));
%
%   function z = klein_zfcn(u,v)
%     r = klein_rfcn(u);
%     z = r.*sin(v);
% April 20 2016

%   function r = klein_rfcn(u)
%     r = 4*(1-cos(u)/2);
%

%%
% And now I can use fsurf to make a Klein bottle.
%
h = fsurf(@klein_xfcn,@klein_yfcn,@klein_zfcn,[0 2*pi 0 2*pi]);
camlight

title('Klein Bottle')

%%
% And we can get a better idea of its shape by making it partially transparent.
%
h.EdgeColor = 'none';
h.FaceColor = [.929 .694 .125];
h.FaceAlpha = .5;
set(gca,'Projection','perspective')

%%
% There are a lot of goodies to play with in these functions, aren't there?
% And we haven't even talked about
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fmesh.html fmesh> and 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fcontour.html fcontour>.
